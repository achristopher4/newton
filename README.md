# newton
## Programming Exercise 6.1
Package Newton’s method for approximating square roots (Case Study: Approximating Square Roots) in a function named newton. This function expects the input number as an argument and returns the estimate of its square root. The script should also include a main function that allows the user to compute square roots of inputs until she presses the enter/return key

An example of the program input and output is shown below:

Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: 2
The program's estimate is 1.4142135623746899
Python's estimate is      1.4142135623730951
Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: 4
The program's estimate is 2.0000000929222947
Python's estimate is      2.0
Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: 9
The program's estimate is 3.000000001396984
Python's estimate is      3.0
Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit:
